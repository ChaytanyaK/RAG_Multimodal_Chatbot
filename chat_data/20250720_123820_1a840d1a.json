    "answer": "The next steps in the MTDF project are:\n\n1. Initiate the Jobs MDTF’s Phase II implementation during the 2021–2025 period. Phase II will focus on supporting large-scale operationalization of the jobs agenda while continuing to support an innovative work program to address knowledge gaps.\n\n2. Continue to implement the SEJLS program and invest in understanding jobs outcomes through data and analytics to strengthen the design consistency of jobs-relevant projects and estimation of jobs outcomes.\n\n3. Promote exchange of best practices and lessons from MDTF outputs and tools to help build development partners’ capacity, supporting dialogue between government agencies and leveraging private sector involvement to accelerate job creation.\n\n4. Maximize linkages to the Jobs and Economic Transformation (JET) theme, focusing on the poorest countries by supporting JET operationalization during Phase II and improving measurement of jobs effects, including indirect jobs effects from WBG operations.\n\n5. Advance the Jobs-After-COVID workstream, focusing on medium-term prospects for accelerating job transitions in developing countries post-pandemic and supporting pioneering diagnosis and solutions to post-pandemic jobs challenges.\n\nAdditional focus areas include:\n- Taking account of private sector development potential and creating incentives for private sector investors.\n- Closing gender gaps in jobs outcomes.\n- Supporting access to jobs for vulnerable groups, including youth, fragile and minority groups, and people with disabilities.\n- Ensuring coherent linkages with related WBG strategic priorities and donor community agendas.\n- Generating solutions relevant across different geographical regions and country contexts, reflecting the varied nature of jobs challenges experienced.",
