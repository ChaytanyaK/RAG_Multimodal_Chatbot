    "question": "What were the activities conducted under the Jobs MDTF grants in Mozambique",
    "answer": "The activities conducted under the Jobs MDTF grants in Mozambique included:\n\n1. **More and Better Jobs from Crops and Trees in Mozambique**: This activity focused on identifying entry points and policy implications for creating more and better jobs through three agricultural value chains: cassava, cashew, and plantation forestry. It aimed to help inform ongoing debates on how agriculture and natural resource management can contribute to rural jobs transformation.\n\n2. **Mozambique Agriculture Aggregator Pilot Study (MAAP)**: This study presented findings from a three-year evaluation of aggregator schemes in Mozambique. It sought to understand factors behind the success of some anchor firms and in terms of farmer profitability, particularly focusing on how poor contract growers might benefit from aggregator firms’ expansions despite initial low firm returns.\n\n3. **Study of Cassava, Cashew, and Plantation Forestry Value Chains**: Part of the Let’s Work program, this study aimed to understand the potential for inclusive private sector-led job creation by integrating farmers into agribusiness. A policy note was also developed highlighting challenges to accelerate structural transformation in Mozambique.\n\nThese activities aimed at accelerating job transformation, especially in rural and agricultural sectors, by supporting private sector-led job creation and addressing policy challenges.",
